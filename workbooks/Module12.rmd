## Module 12

## Visualizing Data with the Tidyverse

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a process of investigating data that is analogous to detective work
  - Data is systematically investigated from different perspectives until a "story" emerges

- A working hypothesis is generated
  - "outliers" (extreme values) and invalid assumptions are identified
  - "Let the data speak for themselves" â€“ use visualizations to construct the story and then communicate it to stakeholders
