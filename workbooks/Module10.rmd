## Module 10

## Introduction to the Tidyverse

![](images/tidyverse-stickers.png)

- "The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

  - core packages are ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and  forcats, which provide functionality to model, transform, and visualize data

  - <https://tidyverse.org>
  
  - The package emphasizes functional programming, a programming strategy which uses mathematical functions and expressions

- While popular, the tidyverse is not without its critics

  - In particular, the functional programming emphasis makes it difficult for non-programmers to use
  
  - <https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic>
  
## Loading the Tidyverse

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#library(tidyverse)
```

- You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it (via library) every time you start a new R session

### Version Warnings and Updating Base R

- When you load packages you may see warnings about your version of R.
- If the library fails to load you can use the following commands from within RStudio to update your baseR version:

> install.packages("installr")
> library(installr)
> updateR()

- Be sure to check package documentation before upgrading in case your package doesn't support a more recent version of R.

### Data Visualization with ggplot2

### Answering Questions with Visualization

- Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
  - The answer is intuitive but visualization of the data can make it precise
  - What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?

- The mpg Data Frame
  - Test your intuition using the mpg data frame found in the ggplot2 package (ggplot2::mpg).
  - A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows)
    - A tibble is a "modern reimagining" of a data frame (Wickham)
  - mpg contains observations collected by the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of cars

```{r}
# be sure to install and load the tidyverse
# package in the previous chunk
mpg
```

### The ggplot2::mpg Data Frame

- Among the variables in mpg are:
  - displ, a car’s engine size, in liters
  - hwy, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg)
    - A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance
- enter ?mpg to learn more

### Creating a ggplot

```{r}
# put displ on the x-axis and hwy on the y-axis:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### ggplot Basics

- ggplot() creates a coordinate system to which layers can be added.
- The first argument of ggplot() is the dataset to use in the graph
  - ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting
- Complete the graph by adding one or more layers to ggplot()
  - The geom_point() function adds a layer of points, which creates a scatterplot.
  - ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that add a different type of layer to a plot

- The mapping argument defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties
- The aes() function adds "aesthetic mappings" which map to variables in the data
  - The x and y arguments of aes() specify which variables to map to the x- and y-axes
  - ggplot() looks for the mapped variables in the data argument (e.g. the mpg data frame)

### The mpg Plot

- We can move the aesthetic mapping of the variables into the ggplot function, then the point layer specification is simpler.
- We can also add a trendline using the lm function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(displ,hwy)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

- The plot shows a negative relationship (downward trendline) between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy). 
- In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel.

### Aesthetic Mappings

- An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot 
  - Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. 
- You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties, called "levels". 
  - For instance, changing the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color can make the point small, triangular, or blue:

![](images/aes-mappings.png)

- You can add a third variable to a two-dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an aesthetic
  - map the colors of your points to a third variable "class" to reveal the class of each car:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(
     mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

- To map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside aes() 
- ggplot() will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (e.g. a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling
  - ggplot() will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values
- We can map class to the size aesthetic in the same way.
  - In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. 
  - Note: mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size, e.g. smallest to largest) is not a good idea

```{r}
 ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(
               mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
# Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised
```

### Other Aesthetic Mappings

- alpha (transparency)

![](images/aes-map-alpha.png)

- shape
  - (note that by default, only6 shapes are used, additionalpoints are unmapped)
  
![](images/aes-map-shape.png)

### x and y Aesthetics

- Once you map an aesthetic, ggplot() selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic, and constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values
- For x and y aesthetics, ggplot() does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label
  - The axis line acts as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values
  - You can also set the geom aesthetic properties manually
  - For example, to make all of the points in the mpg plot blue:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(
   mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

### Facets

- Another way to add variables, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into facets
  - facets are subplots that each display one subset of the data

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
     facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

### The facet_wrap Function

- facet_wrap wraps a 1 dimensional sequence of panels into 2 dimensions
  - The first argument of facet_wrap() should be a formula
  - The variable that you pass to facet_wrap() should be discrete (not continuous)

### The R Formula Operator ~

- The tilde operator ~ characterizes formulas in R
- The variable on the left-hand side of a tilde (~) is the dependent variable, while (one or more) variables on the right-hand side are independent variables
  - If there are more than one independent variable they are joined by plus signs +
  - A left-hand side variable is not required, as shown in the above example

### Two-Variable Faceting with facet_grid()

- To facet your plot with a combination of two variables, add facet_grid() to your plot call
  - The first argument of facet_grid() is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by ~

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
        geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
        facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```
