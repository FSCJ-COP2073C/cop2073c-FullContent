### Module 1 Exercise

- Create an R script which performs the following three tasks:

  - Create, store, and display a sequence of values from 5 to -11 that progresses in steps of 0.3.
  - Repeat the vector c(-1,3,-5,7,-9) twice, with each element repeated 10 times, store and display the result, then display the result, sorted from the largest value to the smallest.
  - Create, store, and display a vector containing 15 valuesin a sequence from 10 to 19.

```{r}
# Module 1 Exercise

# a. Create and store a sequence of values from 5 to -11 that progresses in steps of 0.3

a <- seq(from=5,to=-11,by=-0.3)
a

# b. Repeat the vector c(-1,3,-5,7,-9) twice, with each element repeated 10 times, and store the result. Display the result sorted from largest to smallest.

b <- rep(x=c(-1,3,-5,7,-9),times=2, each=10)
b

# sort will display sorted vector
sort(b,decreasing=T)

# c. Create a vector containing 15 values in a sequence from 10 to 19

c <- seq(from=10,to=19,length.out=15)
c
```

### Module 2 Exercise

- Step a: Use the vector c(2,4,6) and the vector c(1,2) in conjunction with rep and * to produce the  vector c(2,4,6,4,8,12).
- Step b: Create a 3x2 (3 rows, 2 cols) matrix from the vector created in Step a.
- Step c: Use cbind to add the vector c(3,6,9) to the matrix produced in Step b.
- Step d: Create a 3-dimensional (single-layer) array from the matrix produced in Step c.
- Step e: Provide an extraction expression which extracts the middle element (the value 8) from the array produced in Step d.
- Step f: Use the extraction expression from Step e (not the extracted value) to multiply all elements of the array produced in Step d by 8.

```{r}
# Module 2 Exercise

# a. use the vector c(2,4,6) and the vector c(1,2)
# in conjunction with rep and * to produce the
# vector c(2,4,6,4,8,12)
#
v <- rep(x=c(2,4,6),times=2) * rep(x=c(1,2),each=3)
v
#
# rep(x=c(2,4,6) produces 2,4,6,2,4,6
# rep(x=c(1,2),each=3) produces 1,1,1,2,2,2
# * is the multiplication operator,
# we do an element-by-element multiplication:
# 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6
# 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2
# 2, 4, 6, 4, 8, 12
#
# b. create a 3x2 (3 rows, 2 cols) matrix from the
# vector produced in step a.
m <- matrix(v, nrow=3, ncol=2)
m
#
# c. use cbind to add the vector c(3,6,9) to the
# matrix produced in step b.
m2 <- cbind(m, c(3, 6, 9))
m2
#
# d. create a 3-dimensional (single-layer) array from
# the matrix produced in step c.
a <- array(m2,dim=c(3,3,1))
a
#
# e. provide an extraction expression which extracts
# the middle element (the value 8) from the array
# produced in step d.
#
a[2,2,1]
#
#
# f. use the extraction expression from step e (not
# the extracted value) to multiply all elements of
# the array produced in step d by 8.
a2 <- a * a[2,2,1]
a2
```

### Module 3 Exercise

- Create and save the following data as a data frame, where the PERSON column is a character string and both GENDER and FUNNY columns are factors with M/F and Low/Med/High as levels, respectively.

![](images/ex3table.png)

- Use the str() function to verify the characteristics of each column.

- Add an AGE column to the data frame with the following ages:

![](images/ex3ages.png)

- Then use column indexing to swap the AGE and FUNNY columns so AGE is the 3rd column and FUNNY is the 4th column.

- Add the following row to your data frame: "Sally", "F", 37, "High".

- Note that at this point str() indicates the AGE column is a character vector, not numeric. Convert that column to numeric.

- Display your final data frame and verify its structure (chr, factor, num, factor).

```{r}
# create the data frame
dframe <- data.frame(
            PERSON=c("Stan","Francine","Steve","Roger","Hayley","Klaus"),
            GENDER=factor(x=c("M","F","M","M","F","M")),
            FUNNY=factor(x=c("High","Med","Low","High","Med","Med"),
                              levels=c("Low","Med","High")))

# verify the column structure
str(dframe)

# add an AGE column
dframe$AGE <- c(41,28,33,56,45,60)

# reorder columns 3 and 4
dframe <- dframe[,c(1,2,4,3)]

# add the new row
dframe <- rbind(dframe, c("Sally", "F", 37, "High"))

# change AGE from character to numeric
dframe$AGE <- as.numeric(dframe$AGE)

# display dataframe and verify structure
View(dframe)
str(dframe)
```
